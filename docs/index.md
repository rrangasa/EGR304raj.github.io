## Introduction
This datasheet documents a user interface subsystem for an embedded systems project. The subsystem consists of push buttons, LEDs, and a light-resistive sensor controlled by a Microchip PIC18F57Q43 microcontroller. This reference includes the design, component selection, schematic, and power budget.

### Project Summary

This subsystem provides user interaction for a larger embedded system project. It includes:

- **Inputs**: One push button and one light-resistive sensor
- **Outputs**: One LED (green) for visual feedback
- **Controller**: Microchip PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano
- **Power**: 5V regulated supply from an LM7805T voltage regulator

The subsystem connects to other project modules through three 8-pin connectors. Components were selected for reliability and ease of assembly.

This is an individual contribution to Team 101's EGR 304 project. For the complete system overview, see the [team report](https://egr304-2025-f-101.github.io/team101.github.io/).

### My Contribution

This datasheet documents my individual contribution to the Team 101 embedded systems project. As part of a collaborative effort, I was responsible for designing and documenting this complete user interface subsystem/Hub.
