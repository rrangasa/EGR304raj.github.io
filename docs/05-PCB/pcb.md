## Overview

This PCB serves as the central hub for a PIC18-based water sprinkler system. It includes an LM7805 regulator supplying 5 V / 1.5 A from a 9 V input with fuse protection. The PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano interfaces with analog inputs (potentiometer and sensors), digital I/O for push buttons, and PWM outputs for motor and speaker control. Three 8-pin connectors provide power and communication to subsystem boards. Debugging features include an onboard LED, push button, test points, and accessible headers, with ground planes for signal stability and integrated overcurrent protection.
