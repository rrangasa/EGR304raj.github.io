## Overview

This schematic shows the central hub board for a water sprinkler system controlled by a PIC18; MCC configures ADCC for analog inputs from the potentiometer and the sensor board, GPIO with Interrupt‑on‑Change for the push button and other digital signals, and EUSART/UART for inter‑board data exchange. Motor and speaker control use GPIO and PWM/CCP.
