However, I receive sensor data from the sensor subsystem, provide motor data to the motor subsystem, and also process input from a potentiometer.

This confirmed that the regulator\u2019s 1500 mA capacity provides ample headroom. Heat dissipation was also evaluated, showing that a linear regulator (9\u21925V) would lose about 0.86 W, while a switching regulator would lose only 0.12 W.
